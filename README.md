# Motives-for-Ineffective-Giving
This project is my research thesis paper titled, "Motives For (In)effective Giving: The Case In South Africa"  

The purpose of this research is to better understand the motives people have for giving and how impact/effectiveness factors into these motives. 
The goal is to understand how different motives lead people to give ineffectively â€” not based off impact. 
Past literature has shown that there are different motives that might decrease willingness to give to the most effective charities. 
For example, individuals who are nationalistic are likely to give to local charities as opposed to foreign charities even if the foreign charity is more effective.

The literature shows that most people prefer giving to charities that are not the most effective. 
Some of the reasons for this preference include ingroup bias, a lack of information about the effectiveness of different charities, and the tendency to view giving as a subjective decision. 
My study differs from those that have been done in the past because it focuses on the cross-cultural differences in motives for giving.
