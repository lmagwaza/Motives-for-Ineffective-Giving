# Motives-for-Ineffective-Giving
This project is my research thesis paper titled, "Motives For (In)effective Giving: The Case In South Africa"  

## Purpose of the research
The purpose of this research is to better understand the motives people have for giving and how impact/effectiveness factors into these motives. 
The goal is to understand how different motives lead people to give ineffectively â€” not based off impact. 
Past literature has shown that there are different motives that might decrease willingness to give to the most effective charities. 
For example, individuals who are nationalistic are likely to give to local charities as opposed to foreign charities even if the foreign charity is more effective.

The literature shows that most people prefer giving to charities that are not the most effective. 
Some of the reasons for this preference include ingroup bias, a lack of information about the effectiveness of different charities, and the tendency to view giving as a subjective decision. 
My study differs from those that have been done in the past because it focuses on the cross-cultural differences in motives for giving. 

## Data 
My data is made up of a sample of two groups: a rural and an urban group. The urban group includes individuals who 1. have an annual income above
R500K, 2. have at least a bachelors degree, 3. reside in an urban environment. The rural group includes individuals who 1. have an annual income
below R500K, 2. have completed at least some high school, 3. reside in a rural environment. In total there are 560 observations. 

## Research Plan
The experiment is conducted through a Qualtrics survey. Participants first answer a series of demographic questions about themselves, and then are asked to both (a) answer a series of questions about prescriptive (what people ought to do) norms in their community and (b) make a series of charitable choices (c) finally, they make a donation choice after they read a prompt detailing the background of two children with different characterisitcs.

## Analysis 
Using OLS models and a utility maximizing structural model, this research provides insights that help us understand the trade-offs people make between effectiveness and meaningfulness when they donate. Further, this paper shows that salient characteristic matches between a donor and a recipient, such as matches on nationality and suffering from a familiar affliction, increase donation amounts. This research has the potential to both inform highly effective charities on how to better target different cultures as well as advance our theoretical understanding on giving motives by shedding light on how culture impacts the development and acquisition of these disparate motives.
