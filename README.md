# Motives-for-Ineffective-Giving
This project is my research thesis paper titled, "Motives For (In)effective Giving: The Case In South Africa"  

## Purpose of the research
The purpose of this research is to better understand the motives people have for giving and how impact/effectiveness factors into these motives. 
The goal is to understand how different motives lead people to give ineffectively â€” not based off impact. 
Past literature has shown that there are different motives that might decrease willingness to give to the most effective charities. 
For example, individuals who are nationalistic are likely to give to local charities as opposed to foreign charities even if the foreign charity is more effective.

The literature shows that most people prefer giving to charities that are not the most effective. 
Some of the reasons for this preference include ingroup bias, a lack of information about the effectiveness of different charities, and the tendency to view giving as a subjective decision. 
My study differs from those that have been done in the past because it focuses on the cross-cultural differences in motives for giving. 


## Data 
My data is made up of a sample of two groups: a rural and an urban group. The urban group is made up of individuals who 1. have an annual income above
R500K, 2. have at least a bachelors degree, 3. reside in an urban environment. The rural group is made up of individuals who 1. have an annual income
below R500K, 2. have completed at least some high school, 3. reside in a rural environment. In total there are 560 observations. 

## Research Plan
All participants first answer a series of demographic questions about themselves, and then are asked to both (a) answer a series of questions about prescriptive (what people ought to do) norms in their community and (b) make a series of charitable choices (c) finally, they make a donation choice where they read a prompt about two children with various characterisitcs.
